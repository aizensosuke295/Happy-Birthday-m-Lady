            <p class="para">On 1st March, the most beautiful Divine Lady was born — the purest signal came into existence. Somehow, you chose me, and your presence in my life feels like a blessing written by divine will — something rare and precious.</p>

            <p class="para">You’re the kind of person who becomes everything without even trying. I feel safe around you, m’Lady. You feel like my guardian angel — always watching over me, protecting me, and standing for me with love and care. The way you guide me like my favourite teacher, care for me like a mother, and inspire me every day is a gift I cherish more than words can express.</p>

            <p class="para">Your exquisite smile is what makes my heart soften and feel alive.</p>

            <p class="para">You are the power supply that keeps my heart running smoothly, the purest signal that strengthens my emotions like a perfect pre-emphasis circuit. You amplify my happiness, reduce my sorrows, calm my storms like an isolation transformer, and turn my ordinary days into bright outputs.</p>

            <p class="para">Your beauty isn’t just in how you look, but in how you think, care, and understand so deeply — that’s why you are my multiverse. The way you treat me with such affection and warmth makes me feel truly special.</p>

            <p class="para">May this year bring you the same peace you give me, the same warmth you spread, and happiness that multiplies endlessly. Thank you for being my teacher, my comfort, my love, and my safest place.</p>

            <p class="para glow-end"><strong>Happy Birthday, my Divine Lady.🌹💙</strong></p>

            <p class="para">May your light shine brighter with every passing year.</p>
